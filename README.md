There are some utilities I use.


## instant_apache

Create configuration and run Apache webserver with document root in current
or given directory.


## svnlog

Show Subversion repository history log with diffs for each commit.

Output is similar to `git log -p --color`. Uses `colordiff` for coloring
`svn diff` output; if colordiff is not found, output is not colored.


## trim

Trim excessive whitespace from line ends in text files.


## xwatch

Run one command repeatedly, separate outputs with blank lines.

This is an alternative to the `xwatch` command, but the fullscreen-like
behavior is done with blank lines, so the output can be easily scrolled.


## tests
